# shopman-stockman

Inventory management with quants, holds, and planning.

Part of the [Django Shopman](https://github.com/pablondrina/django-shopman) commerce framework.

## Overview

**Domain:** Estoque
**Namespace:** `shopman.stockman`
**Pip package:** `shopman-stockman`

### Main Models

Quant, Move, Hold, Position, Batch, StockAlert

## Installation

```bash
pip install shopman-stockman
```

## Quick Start

```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "shopman.stockman",
    # ...
]
```

## Architecture

This package is a **Core app** — it provides domain-specific models, services, and protocols with zero dependencies on other Shopman apps (except `shopman-utils`).

Communication with other apps happens via `typing.Protocol` — no direct imports. The framework layer (`django-shopman`) orchestrates integration between core apps.

## Conventions

- **Monetary values:** `int` in centavos with `_q` suffix (e.g., `price_q = 1050` → R$ 10.50)
- **Identifiers:** `ref` (not `code`). Exception: `Product.sku`
- **Inter-app communication:** `typing.Protocol` + adapters, no direct imports

## Development

This package is developed in the [django-shopman](https://github.com/pablondrina/django-shopman) monorepo under `packages/stockman/`.

```bash
# Clone the monorepo
git clone https://github.com/pablondrina/django-shopman.git
cd django-shopman

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e packages/stockman

# Run tests
make test-stockman
```
